iiPython's Modified NETGEAR UI
=============================================

Active devices:
  - NETGEAR C7800

This project is a rewrite of the interface of the NETGEAR C7800 written with much more
modern techniques. It still makes calls to the original interface however, as the router
isn't rootable or supported by something like OpenWRT (yet!).

It may not work for your device depending on your model and firmware version.
It's also very much a work in progress, feel free to make issues but I might not be able
to get to all of them.

This README will probably stay as a text file, it's simple and easy to add to (just like
this project).

Licensing
=============================================

This project is under the MIT license.

The original web UI used components licensed under the GPLv2, however since this modification
does not directly contain any source code from the original interface, the GPLv2 does not apply.
